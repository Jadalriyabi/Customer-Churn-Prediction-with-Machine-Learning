## Introduction

Customer churn occurs when customers stop doing business with a company. The ability to predict which customers are likely to churn can help businesses implement strategies to retain them. This project uses a dataset of customer information and service usage to predict churn with various machine learning algorithms.

The project is implemented in a Jupyter Notebook, walking through the end-to-end process of data preprocessing, model selection, training, and evaluation.

## Data Overview

The dataset used in this project includes the following information about customers:
- **Demographics:** Gender, age, etc.
- **Account Information:** Contract type, tenure, monthly charges, total charges, and payment method.
- **Service Usage:** Number of services subscribed (e.g., internet service, phone lines, etc.).
- **Churn:** A binary variable indicating whether a customer has churned (yes or no).

The target variable is the churn label, which we aim to predict.

## Project Structure

This project is primarily contained within a single Jupyter notebook:

- **ChurnProject.ipynb:** Contains all the steps from data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and performance comparison.

## Models Used

Several machine learning models have been applied to predict customer churn:

1. **Logistic Regression:** A basic but effective model for binary classification problems.
2. **Random Forest Classifier:** An ensemble method known for handling both numerical and categorical features well.
3. **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** A powerful model for complex classification problems.
4. **XGBoost:** A high-performance gradient boosting model that has been tuned for optimal results.
5. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** A simple algorithm used for classification by finding the nearest neighbors of data points.

## Results

Each model's performance is evaluated based on the following metrics:
- **Accuracy:** The overall correctness of the model's predictions.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score:** Metrics used to evaluate the trade-off between false positives and false negatives.
- **ROC-AUC:** A performance measure for classification problems at various threshold settings.

Detailed evaluation and comparison of these models are provided in the notebook.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Customer-Churn-Prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Start Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. Open the `ChurnProject.ipynb` notebook and follow the step-by-step process to explore and replicate the churn prediction results.

## Usage

Once the notebook is open, follow along with the code and execute each cell to preprocess the data, train models, and evaluate their performance. Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different models or tweak hyperparameters to improve predictions.
